## [II1302 - Weather Predictor Course Project](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Weather-Predictor)
This is the Git repository for project group 8 in the course II1302 Projects and Project Methods.
- [WeatherBrain Website](https://weatherbrainproject.web.app/)
- [Wiki Documments](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Weather-Predictor/wiki/)

Our goal is to create an application that can through machine learning predict upcoming weather / weather phenomenon‚Äôs. The application will receive its data from a simulated IoT-device that can measure certain weather parameters such as temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity.

This project was developed using Microsoft Azure products. The products that were used in the project are **Virtual Machine** (Ubuntu), **SQL Database and Server**, **App Service** (website hosting), **IoT Hub** (intermediate point between IoT device and database) and **Storage Account**.

The weather prediction application will be used by researchers and regular people. The application will be able to give the stakeholders insight in upcoming weather using a prediction model. We believe that the prediction model that will be created will be able to predict the upcoming weather accurately. But as we know our product won‚Äôt be able to predict the weather better than other weather stations. Because of this our goal is not to be better but rather offer a solution. That solution is that most weather websites only offer weather reports for entire cities. Our product will be able to offer precise weather data at a specific position using the IoT device. This will give the user a chance to choose a location where to track and predict the upcoming weather.

## [ID1019 - Programming II](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Programming-II-ID1019)
The course goes through partly the programming techniques that are used in functional programming languages, partly how programmes can be divided into several executing threads and how these can be coordinated. Examples of programming techniques are recursive definitions, non-updateable data structures, functions of higher order and so called ‚Äúclosures‚Äù. Coordination of multiple threads is shown, partly through modification of common data structures, partly through message passing between processes.

The course will use a programming language as the main language but also show similarities and differences with other functional languages.

### Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, students should be able to:

- use recursion, pattern matching and non-modifiable data structures upon implementation in a functional programming language.

For higher grades, the student should also be able to:

- use functions as first order objects and work with the functions of higher order
- explain the basics of functional programming, its structure and operational semantics
- evaluate functions with regard to time complexity
- use message based multi-threaded programming.


## [IK1203 - Networks and Communication](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Networks-and-Communication-IK1203)
The course is an introduction to networking, protocols and communication.

We study how large international networks are constructed from the individual computers, via local area, city and national networks. We use the Internet as or working example of such a network. The aim of the course is to give insights into both the theory and practice of the area.

The focus of the course is on the protocols and algorithms used, and we will follow how they are used and implemented into the TCP/IP-stack - the basis of the Internet.

Content and learning outcomes
- Flow control and error control: flow control (stop&wait, sliding window), error detection and error handling, error correcting codes, retransmission (ARQ).
- Layered models: overview of OSI and TCP/IP.
- LAN (Local Area Network) and LAN-systems: topologies, access- techniques and protocols, token ring, Ethernet, wireless networks bridged networks, spanning tree computation and VLAN.
- Packet and circuit switching: WAN (Wide Area Network) and public networks, principles, characteristics and protocols.
- Internetworking and IP: design principles and building blocks, connection oriented vs. connectionless protocols, Internet routing and Internet Protocol (IP).
- Transport layer protocols: TCP, UDP.
- Communcation models: "Client-server" and "peer-to-peer".
- Applications: DNS, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, Telnet mm.
- Network programming.


## [DH2642 - MovieBoxDB Course Project](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/MovieBoxDB)
What we have decided to create is a website that showcases movies. It is possible to search for a specific movie and observe information about that specific movie such as actors, release date, genre, score etc. The site allows users to add shows to a watchlist and a favourites list where they can store their favourite movies. The site also has score for each show, and it is possible to sort through all movies depending on multiple factors such as genre, language, release dates, region and more. The way that users are able to store their movies is by creating an account and logging in. This gives them access to edit different aspects of their profile such as bio, profile picture and name. Creating an account also gives the user access to the MovieMatcher, which is a game inspired by the dating app "Tinder", where the user swipes in one of the four directions for movies depending on whether or not they want to skip, add to favourites, add to watchlist or see more info about the movie.


## [DH2642 - Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Interaction-Programming-and-the-Dynamic-Web-DH2642)
Interaction programming gives the basic Model-View-Controller principles for developing interactive applications. These principles can be applied to many desktop, mobile or web apps frameworks. The course currently applies these principles to web applications, using JavaScript, DOM APIs, HTML, CSS etc. These front-end applications use data from remote back-ends using web APIs.

Course contents
- JavaScript for interaction programming, callbacks, synchronous and asynchronous code, functional programming.
- Web development interfaces (API): REST, JSON, AJAX, Fetch, Promises.
- Local data: cookies, local storage.
- User interfaces, appearance: HTML, CSS, DOM API, other tree based frameworks for user interfaces (e g Android).
- User interfaces, interaction: events, event levels, event propagation, event management.
- User interfaces, architectures: Model-View-Controller.
- User interfaces, frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.

## [IV1351 - Data Storage Paradigms](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Data-Storage-Paradigms-IV1351)

- Introduction to databases, data storage and information administration
- The relational model
- XML
- Conceptual modeling and Logical database design
- Query languages
- Embedded query languages

### Project Description, the Soundgood Music School
The purpose is to facilitate information handling and business transactions for the Soundgood music school company, by developing a database which handles all the school's data and also an application that can handle some of the transactions.

Building a database without structure will most likely end up failing or being extremely bad. In this project the author will structurally build a database for the Soundgood music school. The author solved the task by building a conceptual model, logical model and then translating it to SQL code to create the database itself. The database can perform various of different tasks such as managing the school¬¥s instruments, lessons, students, and instructors. A command line interface will be developed to manage some aspects of the database. The author will be discussing and motivating each step of designing the database and how each step of the project was solved.
